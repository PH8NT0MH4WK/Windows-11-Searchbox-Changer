# Windows-11-Searchbox-Changer

This is inspired by Techbased's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AfCmO09xkk Just a simplified and more visual all-in-one package created by me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use:

MAKE SURE THAT THE SEARCH ICON IS ENABLED IN SETTINGS!
Also, Make sure that you are in the Windows 11 Developer channel for 22H2.
If you are not, searchbox 6 will not work.

Ok, let's begin!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Python

- Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download.

- You will NOT need to know python

- It is used to open .py files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Install Vivetool

- Go to https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases to download.

- Make sure you installed it into System32.

- ^ This will be important as this is how the commands are run in the SearchChanger.py file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Run the SearchChanger.py file.

- Enter any number from 1 - 6, or type "Reset" to reset it back to normal.

- If you do not know what each option does, check the Options.png file.

- Ater you are done, close the command prompt window.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Run the Restart.bat file.

- This will easilly restart Windows File Explorer.
